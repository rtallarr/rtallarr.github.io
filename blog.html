                        <h2 class="mb-3">Part 1: Idea & Inspiration – Why Build a Cocktail Maker?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Every good project starts with a spark — an itch to automate something fun, 
                            improve a process, or just challenge yourself with something cool. 
                            For me, building a cocktail maker was all about pushing my boundaries and learning new skills.
                            <br>
                            I wanted to challenge myself to work with soldering, PCB's, higher-power electronics, relays, and real electronics — areas I hadn’t touched before. 
                            Mixing hardware with software has always fascinated me, and what better way to dive deeper than by making a machine that can pour cocktails automatically?
                            <br>
                            I’m documenting this project day by day — not through a step-by-step tutorial, but as a log of discoveries, small victories, and inevitable mistakes.
                            Think of this blog as a journal of the process, with all the ups and downs included.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3">The goal</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            The vision was simple (maybe not)
                            Build a device that can accurately pour different liquids to mix cocktails at the push of a button. <br>
                            But with each Google search, I wanted more — more features, more cocktailers, ice dispensers, Bluetooth control, touchscreens, and much, much more. <br>
                            What started as a simple idea quickly became an excuse to dive deep into:

                        <p class="lead">
                            While the concept of robotic bartenders isn’t new, several DIY projects online inspired me:
                            <ul>
                                <li><a class="m-2 justify-content-left" href="https://github.com/rtallarr" target="_blank">a</a></li>
                                <li>BarBot and other automated cocktail machines shared on YouTube and Reddit</li>
                                <li>Open-source projects like BarMixvah</li>
                                <li>Smart kitchen and home automation gadgets</li>
                                <li>My own past experience with Arduino projects, now stepping up to more complex hardware</li>
                            </ul>
                            I wanted to take a modular, approachable path — no overcomplicated mechanics or custom 3D printed parts at first, but something functional and upgradeable.
                            <!-- But I’m not jumping straight into the full machine. -->
                            <!-- The plan is to build a working prototype first — something ugly, simple, and flexible enough to test ideas, wiring, and code. No 3D-printed parts or polished case yet — just tubing, pumps, relays, and a lot of trial and error on a breadboard. -->
                            <!-- Once I have a solid prototype that actually works (and doesn’t leak or short), then I’ll think about refining it into the “real” version. -->

                        <p class="lead">
                            After deciding to build the cocktail maker, I did what any reasonable person would do: opened twenty tabs, searched for hours and days, watched tutorials and guides, components, other peoples builds.
                            This part of the process was honestly fun. Between the electronics, tubing, pumps, and basic tools I didn’t have yet, I was deep into “DIY cocktail machine starter pack” territory.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3">Things I Already Had</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Luckily, I wasn’t starting from absolute zero. I had a few parts left over from past mini-projects:
                            Arduino Uno – A solid board for prototyping, though I knew I'd switch to an ESP32 later.
                            Jumper wires – Always useful for testing on breadboards.
                            Breadboard – Already broken in from past projects.
                            AC cable and plug (probably?) – Handy for connecting to a future power supply or wall adapter.
                            Some copper cables lying around – Perfect for wiring up the prototype without running out.
                            Not enough to build the machine, but enough to start messing around.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3">Things I Needed to Order</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            I split the shopping list into two parts: the tools I needed to properly work with electronics, and the prototype components I’d need to start building the actual cocktail maker.
                            Tools:
                            I realized I needed some basic tools to get started:
                            Solder – Leaded, because I wanted my first joints to flow nicely.
                            Soldering iron – Essential for connecting components.
                            Multimeter –  For checking voltage, resistance, and current… or so I hoped.
                            Wire strippers – Because stripping wires with scissors is not a good idea.
                            Prototype Components:
                            Two 12V 500ml peristaltic pumps – The core for moving liquids precisely.
                            4-channel relay module – To control the pumps safely with the microcontroller.
                            0.96-inch OLED display – Honestly, I saw it while browsing and couldn’t resist. It was too cheap to pass up.
                            12V 10A power supply – Plenty of juice for the pumps and electronics.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3">The Multimeter Incident</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Within just three hours of the tool kit arriving, I managed to mess something up.
                            I tried measuring current without switching the probes properly and instantly blew the fuse inside the multimeter. After that, voltage mode stopped working too — only resistance mode still worked.
                            When I opened it up and saw the tiny glass fuse snapped in half, I laughed it off. If you haven’t blown a multimeter fuse yet, are you even doing electronics?

                        <p class="lead">
                            The day after ordering, the soldering iron and multimeter arrived. While waiting, I found an AC cable and plug.

                            After attaching the plug to the cable, the soldering kit arrived, so I did my first soldering test.  
                            Perfect timing since a toy motor I had lying around had its wires pulled out.
